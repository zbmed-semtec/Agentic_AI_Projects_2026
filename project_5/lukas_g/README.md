# CrewAI local starter

A small CrewAI project you can copy and build on. Two agents run in order: one researches a topic, the next writes a short brief. Both call a model on your own machine through [Ollama](https://ollama.com). No cloud API key is required.

```text
starter/
  setup.py                # starts Ollama and downloads the model
  main.py                 # what you run
  llm.py                  # the only place the model is chosen
  crew.py                 # wires agents, tasks, and tools
  config/agents.yaml      # add a role here
  config/tasks.yaml       # add a step here
  tools/example_tool.py   # copy this when you add a tool
```

`{topic}` in the YAML files is filled in when you run the crew.

## What you need

- Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
- About 8 GB of free disk for a small model, more for larger ones
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and able to reach `http://localhost:11434`

`llama3.1:8b` is the default. It is large enough to follow the two-step brief. Smaller models often ignore the task format.

## 1. Install Ollama

**macOS:** download the app from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com), or:

```bash
brew install ollama
```

**Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:** download the installer from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com).

You only need the Ollama program installed in this step. The next step starts it and downloads the model. Do not run `ollama pull` yourself: if your shell has `OLLAMA_HOST` pointed at a port where nothing is listening, that command fails even when Ollama is already running.

## 2. Set up this project

From the project folder, check the Python version first. It must be 3.10 or newer. Python 3.8 and 3.9 cannot install current CrewAI.

```bash
python3 --version
python3 -m venv .venv
```

If that `python3` is too old, install Python 3.12 and create the environment with it, for example `python3.12 -m venv .venv`.

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows Command Prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies. This pulls CrewAI and LiteLLM, which routes `ollama/...` model names to your local server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the environment file and leave the defaults if you pulled `llama3.1:8b`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows Command Prompt use `copy .env.example .env`.

Start Ollama if it is stopped, and download the model named in `.env`:

```bash
python -m starter.setup
```

This looks for a server on `http://127.0.0.1:11434` and on `OLLAMA_HOST`. If one is already running, the download uses that server. If none is running, it starts Ollama on port `11434` and downloads there. A stale `OLLAMA_HOST` in `~/.bashrc` cannot send the download to the wrong port.

The first download of `llama3.1:8b` is several gigabytes. When the command prints `Ready`, continue to the next step.

## 3. Run it

```bash
python -m starter.main
```

Pass your own topic as an argument. It replaces `{topic}` in the agent and task files:

```bash
python -m starter.main "how a city should roll out internal coding agents"
```

The researcher runs first. The writer then receives those notes and prints a brief. The first run is slow because the model loads into memory.

To change the default topic without passing an argument, edit `TOPIC` in `.env`.

## 4. Point it at a different model

Edit `.env`:

```bash
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b
```

Download that model with the same setup command. It reads `OLLAMA_MODEL` from `.env`:

```bash
python -m starter.setup
```

`qwen2.5:7b` is a good next step when you turn on tools. Keep `LLM_TEMPERATURE` around `0.2` so the agents stay on the brief.

If Ollama runs on another computer, set the host and start Ollama so it listens on the network:

```bash
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.20:11434
```

On the Ollama machine:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve
```

## 5. Use LM Studio or another local server

Any server that speaks the OpenAI chat API works. In LM Studio, start the local server (default `http://localhost:1234`). Then set `.env` like this:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=openai_compatible
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:1234/v1
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=your-model-name-as-shown-in-lm-studio
OPENAI_API_KEY=lm-studio
```

`starter/llm.py` reads those values. You do not need to change the agents.

## 6. Add an agent

1. Add a block to `starter/config/agents.yaml`. The top-level name is the method name you will add in Python. Set `llm: local` so it uses the same model.

```yaml
editor:
  role: Editor
  goal: Tighten the brief on {topic} without adding new claims
  backstory: You cut repetition and flag anything the research notes do not support.
  llm: local
  verbose: true
  max_iter: 5
```

2. Add a method in `starter/crew.py` with the same name:

```python
@agent
def editor(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(config=self.agents_config["editor"])
```

3. Give that agent a task (next section). An agent with no task does not run.

## 7. Add a task

1. Add a block to `starter/config/tasks.yaml`. `agent` must match an `@agent` method. `context` lists earlier tasks whose output this step should see.

```yaml
edit_task:
  description: Edit the brief on {topic}. Keep every claim tied to the research notes.
  expected_output: The revised brief, plus a short list of cuts you made.
  agent: editor
  context:
    - write_task
```

2. Add the matching method in `starter/crew.py`:

```python
@task
def edit_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(config=self.tasks_config["edit_task"])
```

Tasks run in the order they are declared in `tasks.yaml`.

## 8. Research publications with tools

The researcher has two tools enabled by default:

- `search_publications` searches Crossref and arXiv and returns publication metadata, abstracts when available, DOI/source URLs, and direct PDF links when listed.
- `read_publication_pdf` downloads a public PDF and extracts text from its first pages. It accepts PDFs up to 25 MB and extracts at most 20 pages per call (6 by default, with a 12,000-character output cap). Scanned/image-only PDFs may have no extractable text.

These tools need internet access, but no search API key. PDF access depends on the publisher/repository offering a public PDF; the tools do not bypass paywalls. The research task asks the agent to cite the records it actually retrieves and not claim it read papers unless PDF extraction returned text. A search result or abstract is not the same as reading the full paper.

Install dependencies after pulling the changes:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Search and PDF text are provided to the local model as context, so lengthy papers can still take time to analyze. The PDF reader limits extracted pages and text to keep tool output manageable.

## 9. Add a tool

The example tool counts words. It stays off until you opt in, because small local models often mishandle tool calls. The publication tools above are enabled for the researcher in `starter/config/agents.yaml`.

1. In `starter/config/agents.yaml`, uncomment the tool on the agent that should use it:

```yaml
tools:
  - word_count
```

2. Run the crew again. `word_count` is already defined in `starter/crew.py` and implemented in `starter/tools/example_tool.py`.

To add your own tool, copy `starter/tools/example_tool.py`, change the class, then expose it from the crew:

```python
@tool
def my_tool(self):
    return MyTool()
```

Reference `my_tool` under `tools:` in the agent YAML. The YAML name and the method name must match.

## 10. Annotate sampled model tasks

The `mlTask` value is exactly one current Hugging Face task ID (for example,
`text-classification`), not prose, a domain-specific description, or a list. The annotator's
write tool fetches the official Hub task catalog and rejects any value that is not an exact ID.
It also refuses to overwrite a valid task ID. Run the evidence-based annotation crew with:

```bash
python -m starter.main --annotate-mltasks
```

The annotator reviews all records and processes missing or non-catalog `mlTask` values, as well
as valid task IDs that lack valid `mlTaskAnnotation` metadata. It inspects each record's existing
fields first. Confidence uses `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`. If the initial assessment is MEDIUM or LOW,
the agent must search for publications about that model using its exact `modelId`, review the
results, and update its assessment and reasoning from those findings before deciding what to
write. MEDIUM writes require a completed, model-specific publication search and a summary of its
findings; HIGH does not require a search when direct evidence is sufficient. LOW-confidence
annotations are never added to the records. The writer may replace an old free-text value, but
never overwrites a valid Hugging Face task ID. Each successful annotation is stored with an
`mlTaskAnnotation` object containing the confidence level, reasoning, and source when applicable;
MEDIUM annotations also store the publication-search query and findings summary. A valid
existing task can receive this metadata without changing its task ID. The validator checks task
IDs, allowed confidence levels, and required MEDIUM search metadata. Ambiguous records remain
unresolved for human review.

Annotation runs copy `starter/data/input/sampled_models.json` to
`starter/data/output/sampled_models.json` before processing. The tools update only the output
copy; the input remains unchanged. Each run starts from the current input file, and validation
checks the generated output file.

List the current Hugging Face task IDs and check that every record has exactly one valid ID:

```bash
python -m starter.validate_mltasks --list-tasks
```

The validator exits non-zero and identifies missing or invalid values. The task catalog is
fetched from `https://huggingface.co/api/tasks`, so validation and annotation need internet
access. The usual research-and-brief workflow remains the default when no flag is supplied.

## If it fails

| What you see | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `could not connect to ollama server` after `ollama pull` | Run `python -m starter.setup` instead. Your shell's `OLLAMA_HOST` is pointed at a different port than the running server. |
| `Ollama is not running` | Run `python -m starter.setup`. It starts the server on port 11434. |
| Model is not installed | Run `python -m starter.setup`, or set `OLLAMA_MODEL` in `.env` to a model you already have and run setup again. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` error | Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The Ollama path does not call OpenAI; CrewAI still wants a placeholder key when you switch providers. |
| Agent loops or ignores the format | Stay on `llama3.1:8b` or larger, keep temperature at `0.2`, and leave tools commented out until the brief looks right. |
| Connection error to another machine | Use that machine's real IP in `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, and start Ollama with `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`. |
